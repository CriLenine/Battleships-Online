# Battlechips-Online

This project is a *Battleships* game playable online, intended for from 2 to 5 players.

We worked on this project for **3 weeks** as a team of **3 students**.

I worked on the client side of it, and coded : 
 - the creation of players and their respective grid;
 - the ships placement;
 - the target choice;
 - the displaying of each cell when it has been hit;
 - the handling of different turns;
 - and of course some dialogues with the server.
