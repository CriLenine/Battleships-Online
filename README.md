# Battlechips-Online

This project is a *Battleships* game playable online, intended for from 2 to 5 players.  
We worked on this project for **3 weeks** as a team of **3 students**.

## Features

The game starts with a connection menu, in which each player needs to enter the same room name and then hit the *ready* button.  
Once every player is ready, the game starts by placing the 5 ships on the grid.  
Each ship can be rotated and once it is placed, it can be removed by clicking on it which will open a pop up.  

When each player has validated their ship grid, the battleships game can start.  
The players have to wait for their turn, when they can navigate between all the grids to choose a cell to attack.
An animation is played at each shot.  
The cells appear to every player with particular materials if a ship has been hit or not, and the ships appear to everybody once they are fully destroyed.
When there is only one player left with at least one ship, he is declared winner and the game ends.

## My Participation

I worked on the client side of the project, and coded : 
 - the creation of players and their respective grid;
 - the ships placement;
 - the target choice;
 - the displaying of each cell when it has been hit;
 - the handling of different turns;
 - and of course some dialogues with the server.
